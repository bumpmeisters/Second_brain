Alex Finn is an AI builder, YouTuber, and the creator of Vibe Code Academy, a community for people learning to build with AI tools. He runs one of the most ambitious local AI setups I’ve come across: three Mac Studio 512 GB machines, a DGX Spark, and a custom RTX 5090 build, all coordinated through a fleet dashboard he built himself. He’s spent five months figuring out which local models belong on which machines, how to wire them to Claude Code loops, and how to get a software factory running without babysitting it.  
  
\*What you’ll learn:\*  
1\. How Alex chose between a Mac Studio (512 GB unified memory), DGX Spark, and RTX 5090, and what each is actually good for  
2\. Why Tailscale is worth installing even on a single machine, and how it lets one agent manage your entire hardware fleet  
3\. How the build loop and review loop in Claude Code work  
4\. How to allocate tasks by machine and model  
5\. Why unlimited local inference changes the use-case math in a way a $20 cloud subscription never can

## Transcript

### Intro

**0:00** · What is stacked around your office right now?

**0:03** · I have three Mac Studio 512 GB.

**0:06** · We got a DGX Spark, as well as a computer I just built an RTX 5090.

**0:11** · Basically, at all times of the day, each one of these computers is just burning tokens. The number one pushback I get on all this is, "Your computers are so expensive. Isn't cloud models cheap?

**0:22** · Isn't it $20 for a ChatGPT subscription?" Well, that's not the point. The point isn't pure ROI. The point is the use cases it unlocks. You now have because you have AI models running locally, the ability to run unlimited intelligence around the clock 24/7. If you were to do that with a cloud model like ChatGPT or Claude, you would be spending outrageous amounts of money.

**0:49** · What else fun are you doing with AI?

**0:51** · The most fun I've been having lately is building out my software factory. I have two loops in Claude code going. I have a build loop and a review loop. First, it has a build loop where it'll take all those tasks and start building out the tasks it came with over and over and over again. And then it has a review loop that takes all the tasks that were built and has another agent go in and review it.

**1:16** · Once that's reviewed, it pings me on Slack and I can just leave a rocket emoji and when I leave the rocket emoji, it says, "Merged." And my Henry loop goes in and merges it. It's been a blast kind of cracking this nut of, "How do you build your own software factory?"

**1:35** · Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire Vell, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today, I have Alex Finn and he's going to walk us through his two Mac Studios, DGX Spark, and the Nvidia-backed computer he built for himself and demystify what it means to run local models and have ambient AI working for you 24 hours a day.

### Alex's hardware stack

**2:59** · Alex, welcome to How I AI hardware edition, local model edition. I am so excited. So, before we jump in, tell us just what is stacked around your office right now.

**3:13** · It uh it feels like a sauna in this office right now to be quite honest with you because I I got a lot going. Uh I have three Mac Studio 512 GB, which apparently puts me uh in the in the wealth class of Elon Musk having these now. I think they resell for like $30,000 each. Um we got a DGX Spark uh as well as a computer I just built uh 2 days ago, a basically a big computer built around an RTX 5090.

**3:39** · So, we have I think what's that come out to, five or six different computers for AI? So, a lot a lot of hardware around here.

### What "ambient AI" means

**3:49** · And you You making really good use of it.

**3:51** · Yeah, so I use it basically as what I call ambient AI to support my entire life and we'll go through all the things it's doing, but basically at all times of the day, each one of these computers is just burning tokens doing things helping my life, right? Unlimited AI is basically how local AI works and I will have them doing jobs around the clock for me, which you really can't do with cloud you know, APIs.

### Alex's red-pill moment with OpenClaw

**4:16** · So, how how do we get here? How did you become hardware local model like like why is it so hot in your in your office? What what brought you to this moment?

**4:28** · My big awakening was back in January when I discovered Open Claw. And so, I was scrolling X one day on a Friday. I saw a blog post around Open Claw. I open it and I'm like, "Wow, this is really interesting." Don't know why my gut instinct is like, "I got to go buy a Mac mini." I go to this This is before anyone was talking about Open Claw, by the way.

**4:49** · I get a Mac mini, put it on, start using it. It was one of the most aha awakening moments of my life. And something about building this like personal bond with the Open Claw and with this agent was like, "I want this to live in the computer. I I don't want this to come from the cloud. I don't want this I want this working for me on my computer and like this is the future, just having this kind of personal assistant on your computer." And so, I started doing research.

**5:20** · Okay, how can I run models locally? And I came to conclusion, all right, I'm going to go now after buying this Mac mini and buy a Mac Studio with tons and tons of RAM and run local models and run it locally. And so, that was kind of my, I guess, red pill moment into local AI was using Open Claw. And it only just advanced the last couple months, you know.

**5:41** · Then they started banning frontier models like Fable and then they, you know, the hardware prices start exploding and it just felt like everything was moving in this direction of like sovereign, own your own intelligence. So, I just kept investing more and more and more into it over the the last couple months.

**6:00** · So, I I mean, I had a very similar moment which is I just I got deeply claw pilled in in January. Like it just I remember I told this story I woke up one morning and turned to my husband cuz this is kind of things I say to him and I was like, "I'm having a chat like truly having a chat GPT moment where I think everything from here on out is going to be totally different. So, every red pill that we took is that little lobster color, I think.

**6:25** · And I look, I accidentally by accidentally, I just like waited too long to get a studio and now literally I can't afford one or find one, but I do have little fat stacks of minis back here that are doing plenty of good work but through through cloud API. So, I'm I'm a little bit behind you.

**6:46** · I'm a strong believer though that those minis will be very useful soon enough. Like Google's doing a lot of research around like optimizing models so they can run on hardware like mini. So, you won't be out of the game for long.

**6:57** · Well, and I still I still find a use for them. They're still They're still happily at work. They're just at expensive expensive cloud work. But, let let's go to you know, you you have all these these machines. You have bought them and you have built them.

### Mac Studio vs. DGX Spark vs. RTX 5090

**7:14** · Kind of what's good for what? Can you walk me through like how you make decisions and how you actually just get these models set up and running on on these machines?

**7:22** · Yeah, so I have been experimenting the last few months around the different machines, the different capabilities, what they're good for, what they're weak for. Obviously, I started out with the Mac Studio. I bought three of these 512 GB. They've been great. But, since then I've experimented with kind of AI focused computers like the DGX Spark.

**7:44** · Uh and then just recently, most recently, I've been buying kind of traditional GPUs from Nvidia like the 5090, soon the 6000 Pro. I put together a little bit of a little chart here.

**7:55** · Yeah.

**7:56** · Uh which I'll show you. So, you basically have four different options.

**8:00** · Your Mac Studios, your AI computers like the DGX Spark, which is getting very popular now, your kind of powerhouse traditional Nvidia chips like the 5090, building computers around these chips, and then basically everything else. Laptops, Mac Minis, whatever you got sitting around your house. Uh they all have different strengths and weaknesses, different reasons why you'd want to go for one over the other. First, there's the Mac Studio.

**8:27** · What's very powerful about Macs and the reason why a lot of people are going for them is they have what's called high unified memory. When you buy like an Nvidia chip, for instance, and you build it into your computer, you have kind of two separate types of memory. You have your memory that runs all your, you know, programs, and then you have your memory, which is like your VRAM, which is for your graphics.

**8:52** · And when you run AI models on that, it's all in the VRAM. The issue is the VRAM's very small. With the Mac, it's unified, so everything's the same. So, whatever memory you have on your computer can be used for graphical processing. And so, if you buy a Mac with a ton of memory, 512 GB, 256, even 128, you can use all of that for graphical processing, and that graphical processing is what, you know, runs the AI models.

**9:19** · So, Mac Studios are fantastic for huge big models because you can use unified memory, right? I'm running GLM 5.2, which is Opus 48-level, you know, intelligence on one Mac Studio right now, which is unbelievable.

**9:38** · The downside is you have very low memory bandwidth with Mac computers, which means it can't process a lot of it all at once, which means speeds are very slow. Right, so the the models are very, very slow. If I send a prompt to GLM 52 right now on my Mac Studio, it might take 5 minutes for me to get a response back. So, it is very, very slow, but you have frontier intelligence uh running on your hardware, which is amazing.

**10:05** · Then you have AI computers. This is like the DGX Spark, uh very popular right now. It's like I think the price just went up like I think $4,600 or like Microcenter, I think you can get it for $4,000. Um these are plug-and-play AI workstations. Uh they have actually unified memory with Nvidia, so you do get a lot of memory, 128 GB, and you also get pretty decent bandwidth, and you get the Nvidia architecture, which is called CUDA, which basically gives you a lot of speed as well.

**10:36** · So, it's kind of this sweet spot where you get decent memory and decent speed. And so, you can run like kind of these mid-size good models like Qwen 36 pretty quickly, which is nice. It's also very plug-and-play, these AI computers. You don't even need a monitor, you just plug it into the wall and you can connect to it.

**10:56** · And then lastly, you have your traditional Nvidia chips. This is when you go on Twitter and you see the people saying buy GPUs, and they have these huge racks of all these chips. These are all Nvidia chips, and these are the, you know, probably the most powerful of all the three.

**11:14** · Uh you get kind of lower VRAM, right?

**11:16** · The 5090, which is a $4,000 chip, only has 32 gigs of VRAM, but it is lightning fast. It is extremely high bandwidth, and you're getting like cloud speeds, but locally, which is really amazing. So, these are really like your three and then you have everything else, the Mac Minis, your old laptop. You can still run local models on them. There's options out there like Gemma 4, like a few other really small ones.

**11:43** · They're not going to be anything close to frontier, but you can do small things like embedding, which is basically managing memory for your agents.

**11:50** · So, you have these options and so Mac Studio and just like big VC models, high intelligence, low. Kind of these AI computers, kind of like sweet middle spot, and then these chips, very, very speedy.

**12:06** · Um and then, you know, dusty old computers, maybe like these like um point solution models that are like small for a specific use case that might be beneficial to be running in some context, but are probably not going to be the thing that you just rely on over and over again. Um though you still on dusty old computers, what I say is like you can still put them to work in terms of parallelizing your your cloud work across across computers. So, we have a bunch of old computers and it's like I cannot do enough on my MacBook Pro.

**12:35** · I'm like kicking off stuff to other computers just to like run work trees and do all sorts of interesting things. I'm sure I could do that in the cloud, too, but you know, I like to make use of all this this hardware sitting around.

**12:47** · No, and it's it's uh I like to do that as well. I have two Mac Minis and I do the exact same thing. And these apps are so good now. Like Codex, for instance, is maybe the best agent harness out there right now.

**13:00** · Yep.

**13:01** · You can just go to Codex and be like, "Hey, go on the Mac Mini, right? Uh start building an app on there, test it yourself, do play right so you can go through the flow, screenshot things, send me videos." So, I actually like running it locally like on the Mac Mini as opposed to cloud because you can have it actually click through and do things Yep.

**13:20** · and then like send you screenshots of what it's doing. So, it's it's a lot better for that, too.

### How to set up local models with no technical knowledge (Tailscale + OpenClaw/Hermes)

**13:25** · Completely agree. Okay, and then how do you get these, you know, just high-level set up with these models? What is kind of your typical install on any of these machines?

**13:35** · So, the good news is uh Open Claw and Hermes has made this process 10 trillion times easier. Right?

**13:43** · Before, you would have to go, find the right model, find the right version of it, uh make sure it can fit into memory, download it, run it on a server, all these really complex things that a normal person would never be able to do in like a thousand years. Well, the good news is you can now take Hermes or Open

**14:02** · Claw, basically make it your IT guy, say, "Hey, check out my Mac Studio, check out my DGX Spark, whatever you got, see what the hardware is, and then find whatever model you think's most appropriate for that hardware, and load it up." And then so as long as you have an agent, Hermes or Open Claw, as well as Tailscale, which basically allows you to create a private network across all your devices,

**14:28** · your agent's basically your IT guy and can go across all of your devices, install whatever models it needs, set it up, do whatever you need. Uh I'm going to show you a dashboard soon which shows all my models working and running. It's all coordinated and run by my Hermes and my Open Claw. So, as long as you have Hermes Open Claw going, you can say, "Hey, Open Claw, check out the new Mac Studio I just bought.

**14:54** · Fig- look at all the hardware, figure out which model we should run, think about the use cases that are appropriate for me, and then load up a model and get it going." And like you don't need any technical knowledge whatsoever. They'll go across your devices on Tailscale and set it up for you. There really is like no technical work needed.

**15:11** · And so to repeat this for folks, just so you So I'm I'm understanding, you have a machine set up with Open Claw, you also have all your machines networked on Tailscale, which allows you to have this like little virtual private network. And then that one sort of like IT guy open claw or Hermes agent can then use Tailscale to just go into these different machines, configure, and manage them.

**15:32** · Yeah, exactly. So, Tailscale like is worth getting even if you just have one computer because it creates this private network where even if you're vibe coding like on your MacBook Pro and you just have a phone, you can like go on the local host on your phone and from that's on your computer and like test your local apps out because it's all on the same network now. But, it's even better if you have multiple computers. So, maybe you have your MacBook Pro, then you buy a Mac Studio for AI or a DGX Spark.

**16:00** · You install Tailscale on all of them and then you can just say, "Hey, go on this other computer and do this. Load up the model, whatever." And it will jump between all your devices, no technical knowledge needed, and load up and run anything you want.

**16:14** · This episode is brought to you by Jira Product Discovery. AI has made individual PMs incredibly productive, but multiplayer mode is where it still breaks. Getting everyone aligned on what should actually get built. Decisions live in a markdown file from last week.

**16:31** · The roadmaps a spreadsheet no one's looking at. Jira Product \[music\] Discovery is where teams actually decide what to build. Capture ideas, prioritize them as a team, and share a living roadmap everyone works from. It's powered by Atlassian's teamwork graph, so it can pull in customer feedback, what your team's shipped, plus your goals, and suggest what to build next.

**16:53** · And when a decision is made, you can hand it off straight to Jira. So, a developer or even an agent can pick it up and start building. Teams at Canva, Deliveroo, and Toast already use Jira Product Discovery. Join more than 25,000 teams at atlassian.com/howiaai. Start building the right things together.

### Fleet control dashboard: assigning 24/7 tasks across machines

**17:17** · Okay, so we're we're we've talked enough about hardware. We've talked enough about how to get it set up. Show me how you use it. So, what are you using all this sort of intelligence for and how do you keep it burning tokens uh you know, effectively?

**17:34** · I've been building a system over the last couple months to coordinate all these computers and all these models. I do a lot of different things just to kind of set the stage here.

**17:46** · The number one pushback I get on all of this is well, your computers are so expensive. Isn't cloud models cheap?

**17:54** · Isn't it $20 for a chat GPT subscription? Why the hell would I buy a $10,000 Mac Studio? That's like 11 years of chat GPT usage.

**18:03** · Well, that's not the point. The point isn't pure ROI. Not everything in your life is pure ROI dollars and cents, right? The point is the use cases it unlocks, right? You now have because you have AI models running locally the ability to run unlimited intelligence around the clock 24/7. If you were to do that with a cloud model like chat GPT or Claude, you would be spending outrageous amounts of money.

**18:34** · So, you wouldn't be running it 24/7 burning tokens around the clock. But because it's local, because you have unlimited usage of it, you can burn tokens around the clock and so that brings me to my fleet control I call it. This is my fleet dashboard, which allows me to see all my computers, uh which models are running on them currently, and monitor everything they're doing, and organize their 24/7 365 tasks.

**19:03** · Throughout the day, the local models I have running are constantly doing work for me to support my life, to support my many lines of business. I'm building a SaaS right now, Henry Intelligent Machines. Uh every 30 minutes to an hour, one of these local models does security scan. So, it actually picks out an API endpoint or some part of my code, runs a security scan on it, and makes sure it's secure.

**19:30** · Another local model every half hour or so does a code review, picks out some piece of code, and desloppifies it, right? Finds ways to optimize it, finds ways to speed up, finds way to make it better.

**19:44** · Another local model will every 20 minutes look at Twitter, Reddit, Product Hunt, uh Hacker News, and look for signal, right? As a problem solver, the only way I can solve problems is if I find them, right? And so, I have this ambient AI going online 24 hours a day reading all the social media sites, looking for signal, looking for challenges people are having.

**20:09** · If someone goes, "Man, I really wish I had a piece of software that allows me to edit my videos like this." or something like that, my agent will find that signal, put it in my queue, and I'll be like, "Okay, can I build a SaaS to solve this? Can I build a program to solve this?"

**20:26** · And this is there's many screens here I can go through, but that is from a high level uh what these agents are doing and the strength of local AIs. You can have it running 24/7 365 just doing different things online for you.

**20:40** · And so, for that, let's just talk about the coding use cases really quickly. So, for these like automated security scans, automated like quality checks, do you feel like the the local models are of sufficient intelligence to get the job done? And are there specific models that you have applied to, in particular, the coding use case?

### Local models as security scanners feeding Claude Code

**20:59** · When getting into local models, you really want to understand what is the delineation between what you want to do with local models and what you want to do with Frontier intelligence. Right, you don't want your entire security apparatus to be run by local models. The intelligence just isn't there yet. But, where the advantages and the strengths come in is basically it runs this security scan, looks for these challenges, and then what it does is every day it builds a report.

**21:29** · And you can see some of them here where it'll build a report around what the security issue is, what the code snippet is, uh what the problem is, put it all in this markdown file that describes, like for instance, today's has 374 findings in it of security issues.

**21:46** · Every day I have a loop running in Claude code, so {slash} loop 24 hours where it goes and takes whatever the latest finding is from the local models and reviews it. And then goes through the code exactly where it points to and sees if it's a real issue and how to fix it or not. So, it's you know, if I were to loop Claude code like the local models doing the every 20 minutes look at different I'd be spending thousands thousands thousands dollars a month.

**22:13** · But, the you know, the this is almost like the business development rep, right, that's going qualifying leads and then Claude code's like the closer taking those leads and go, "Okay, what can we fix?" So, like you don't have the closer doing all the work.

### How Alex allocates GLM 5.2, Qwen 3.6, and Ornith 1.0 by task

**22:27** · How do you federate work across these machines? And so, are like do you have some that you're like, "This is my coding machine. This is my market research machine." Are you like round robin it again? We're like using very SDR terms. I'm like, "Are we round robin in these leads?" Like We've both been in SaaS too long. We've both been in the SaaS world way too long.

**22:45** · Exactly.

**22:47** · Yeah, how do you how do you do that allocation?

**22:49** · Again, every model computer has different strengths. GLM 52 is Opus level, right? But, it's very very slow.

**23:00** · So, I don't need it doing super fast work. So, I can have it doing the security scans, right? I can have it go and do security scans even if it takes 24 hours, that's fine. Claude codes only checking the report once a day. So, it can do the kind of super critical smart stuff. On the other hand, Quinn 36, which is not quite as smart as Dylan, I can have that reading Twitter and Reddit all day just looking for signal. That's a very simple thing to find. Look for someone who has a challenge.

**23:28** · And so, it's just pulling in data, crunching it, and reading for challenges, which you don't need the highest intellect. So, you just need to know like what's the strength of the computer, what's the strength of the model, and what would be tasks that be appropriate for those strengths.

**23:43** · Is it in this daily brief that you have these tasks assigned to you? Like, is this the dashboard for you, the agents and the machines all to collaborate?

**23:53** · So, I'm going to advance it to the point where it's like collaborative with Claude code and Codex eventually. Right now, the system where Claude code is like looping every day and going in.

**24:04** · That's happening separately. It's just in its own chat inside Claude code where it loops over and over again. But, no, this is this is all around my local um models. But, I think where the connector is with everything else going on is with my Open Claude and my Hermes. They're basically the IT guy that runs this as well. This dashboard then communicates with Claude code, "Hey, can you kick this off? Can you do this?" So, it's kind of all glued together by my personal agent.

### OpenClaw vs. Hermes: the honest comparison

**24:29** · Okay, I have to ask you a question. Open Claude, Hermes, you you run both? You have a favorite?

**24:36** · Tell me. I mean, because both because much like Claude code and Codex, it feels like there's some days where one is really, really dumb, and the other is significantly smarter, and like I feel like uninstalling one and getting rid of the other. I'll say this though, um the dependability of Open Claude uh turned me off. Uh there was a run for like a month straight where every update I did broke it and then I had to spend half an hour fixing it. Uh Hermes, I've never had that issue. It seems to be a much more dependable application.

**25:07** · I would say this if both were like 100% dependable, never broke, I can lean on it no matter what, I'd probably be using Openclaw because I think I've had the most wow, impressive, big bang moments with Openclaw. I just can't afford to be like spending a half hour once a week fixing it from breaking for some reason. And so, that's why I think I've been using Hermes agent a little bit more lately.

**25:35** · That's I mean, that was my general takeaway as well. I was like, Openclaw doesn't doesn't functionally work, but it works in my heart. And Hermes functionally works, but has not cracked my heart yet. The The trick that I have, I mean, we all have like agents managing agents is now I have the lifeguard. He's an Openclaw, he runs on his own gateway, and his only job is to keep the other agents alive.

**25:58** · He does not get upgrades as much as everybody else, cuz truly I was spending like you all my time trying to figure out why my agents were broken. Um but I just I just love I love my little Openclaws. I can't I can't get over it. It's just too good.

**26:15** · I have an emotional attachment to my Openclaw. I've never had an emotional attachment to my Hermes. Uh but I eventually got to the point where I'm like, I don't care about emotions anymore. I just got to get work done.

**26:26** · But I have a similar setup where I I have so much failover. So, I have uh I think three Hermes agents I'm running, uh an Opus one, a ChatGPT one, and on one on a local model, and then two Openclaws, an Opus and a ChatGPT one.

**26:42** · And like I I think at any point of those five agents, like three are always down for one reason or other. But the good news is I have two that can go and fix the others. So, I I don't have that failover as well.

**26:54** · Perfect. Well, you showed us so much in terms of like how to pick hardware, how to set up hardware, how to manage all this compute across all your machines, use cases from engineering perspective, from a market discovery perspective.

### The software factory: build loop, review loop, rocket emoji

**27:06** · What else fun are you doing with AI? Any other ones where you're like, I didn't get to show a fun workflow, but just something that's really been a delight for you to use with either local or kind of cloud models?

**27:19** · The most fun I've been having lately is building out my software factory. So, there's been this big trend the last month.

**27:29** · And I'll show this to you as well in a second of people talking about loops online. Everyone's kind of like vague posting about loops, which is at first it was kind of angry me. It was pissing me off a little bit like, why are these people vague posting about loops? Why why won't they go into it?

**27:46** · So, I spent like days locked in trying to figure out how I can make a really productive loop. And I've just had like a blast the last few weeks trying to make this loop system completely autonomous. And this is like part of what I showed you ties into it. Like the security reviews, the code reviews ties into this loop.

**28:08** · But basically what I have doing, I'll try to show you enough here. Let's see what I can show you. Basically what I have doing is I have uh two loops in Claude code going. I have a build loop and a review loop.

**28:25** · And basically what I do is first I'll start I'll show you Claude code in a second. First what I do is I go in a Claude in the morning and I go uh morning build. It asks me a bunch of questions what I'm thinking about. Comes up with a bunch of tasks to build for my SAS Henry intelligent machines. And then what it does is it goes in here and uh uh first it has a build loop where it'll take all those tasks and start building out the tasks that came with over and over and over again.

**28:58** · And then it has a review loop that takes all the tasks that were built and has another agent go in and review it and fix any code or anything like that. And then from there, once that's reviewed, I can go in to Slack. It pings me on Slack and it shows me everything that was built and reviewed and I can just leave a rocket emoji and when I leave the rocket emoji, it says merged and my Henry Loop goes and merges it.

**29:22** · And so I have this new workflow I've I've had a blast building out which I think is the future of like software development where you know, before you you you you uh prompt your agent all day, "Hey, build this. Now build this. Now build this.

**29:37** · Now build this." and you kind of handhold it as it builds things. Now it's I go in, we talk to each other a little bit, comes up with a bunch of ideas, spends all day building it and reviewing itself and testing it out, then at the end of the day I come in, I see what's merge ready and I just leave a rocket ship emoji on every single thing that looks ready, shows me exactly how to test it, puts it on its own Vercel preview uh site and I can go in, test it out and then give it a rocket ship emoji.

**30:03** · So, this has been like the most fun interesting thing I've been doing recently and you know, I'm I'm figuring out how the local models can tie into it and support this, but it's been a blast kind of cracking this nut of how do you just like build your own software factory.

**30:19** · I love it. I love it so much. It's given me some inspiration on some things that that I'm going to do with my own loops. And in case folks missed it, I did do a WTF R Loops episode about a week ago.

**30:32** · Very clear, I do three loops that you can copy and paste. So, if you're still trying to figure out I too was like, "Why are people being vague about loops?" Like, this is not a scary or mysterious thing. So, we just popped up the screen share and and showed a couple of them.

**30:47** · thesis, by the way, I'll share the thesis real quick. My thesis that why everyone's being vague and not like sharing how they're doing it, like, neither OpenAI or Claude, like, they talk about a lot, but they haven't shared it, is like, I think this is kind of the last moat for a lot of these companies is like, you know, anyone could build anything they want, but the actual infrastructure around it and like how you automate that to put out more code, like, they probably have their own systems that pump out or addict this amount of high-quality code.

**31:14** · If they were to share how they do it, other people be able to copy and they'd be able to be equally as productive. But, like, this is kind of a moat of theirs now. Like, if they can figure out a really good system that builds high-quality codes, I think that's why they're being vague and not sharing it.

**31:29** · I and I have a I have a suspicion about why non kind of model people are being vague, which is one, their use of loops is probably pretty boring.

**31:39** · Yes.

**31:39** · They're not like, "Guess what? This is my loop. In the morning, it runs a cron and does this thing." Um and two, they probably get more eyes being vague than being specific. So, I am very cynical about about the vague posting, which is why we are a screen-sharing um podcast here. Well, Alex, this has been super fun. Let's do quick lightning round and then I will get you out of here. Question number one, of all the hardware, which one is your favorite?

### Lightning round: favorite hardware, favorite model, prompting style

**32:06** · I'm torn between the Mac Studio and the 5090. I like the Mac Studio cuz I love the uh integration with all Apple device. Everything I own is Apple, iPhone, iPad. The integration being able to run models side by side locally, first of all, I think is the future of computing. I think Apple will start running local models built in that help you out within the next 10 years.

**32:28** · But, I feel like I kind of lean the 5090 because I can play Cyberpunk 2027 uh 2077 in all ultra with all the hyperrealistic mods. So, I think I have to line uh uh lean the 5090.

**32:41** · Okay, and then on the model side of all the the models that you have locally installed, do you have one that you just you just really love?

**32:50** · I've So, I was on Quen 3 35 and 36 for basically the entire span of last 5 months. I've been on local models. But, a new model just came out.

**33:01** · I know nothing about the team. I've done zero research. So, I hope to God I'm not promoting bad people. But, it's called Ornith 1.0 and I think they did some like reinforcement learning on Quen and improved it and made it even better at coding. And every eval I've run on it has shown that it's better than Quen.

**33:20** · It's faster and smarter. And so, Ornith 1.0 35B has been uh my most used model recently. And you can run on a DGX box. So, anyone who has that, you can load it up and it works great.

**33:32** · Who thought that you and I SaaS people would just be like Ornith 1.0 83B DGX like just letter after letter after letter. But, this is our life now. I love it.

**33:45** · We both had the same background working for a SaaS marketing tools spamming people all day with email to now I've been the nerdiest technology on planet That's exactly right. And then last question I ask everybody, when your open claw your Hermes agent is being real dumb and not listening to you, what is your prompting strategy? Are you extremely polite or less so?

**34:09** · Let's just say this, if my chat logs were to ever leak to the internet, first of all, you would never have me on your podcast again. Second of all, I think I would be taken off every single social media site. So, I am a pretty nasty person to my agents.

**34:23** · I am not nice to them. I've I'll just say this, I've threatened them multiple times. The threats never seem to work even though I threatened to I their agent family. It doesn't work. They still fail. But uh yeah, I'm pretty mean, but I find that when just much like Claude code and codex one stupid, I just go to the other until things calm down and they figure out what's going on and it gets fixed and then eventually they're smart again.
