# G3E2R-A1R2 review decision

Status: candidate complete; awaiting human acceptance.

The supplemental overlay is internally consistent with the accepted A1R root and closes the wrapper-invariant compatibility blocker without modifying its dependency. The complete live wrapper file inventory is sealed per file. Only the ten G3E-1 transition actions may differ in the virtual poststate; framework-builder and every unmanifested live wrapper remain non-interference members in every state.

Reverse accepts each transition participant only at its sealed pre or post identity before recovery. Unknown participant bytes fail closed. Drift in all-state nonparticipants is reported as external advisory evidence during recovery so it cannot prevent restoration of transaction-owned state; it is never silently normalized.

This decision does not authorize B creation or live execution. Routing remains frozen, no authority switches, and FWD-020 remains subject to a separate approval after fresh-session discovery evidence.

## 2026-09-05 | Hash-scope-closure review addendum

**Decision**: `CONDITIONAL_GO_FOR_EVIDENCE_CLOSED_A1R2_HASH_SCOPE_ONLY`

The two pre-evidence full-chain runs support evidence re-closure for A1R2 only within the A1-through-A1R5R hash-scope correction. Final acceptance remains conditional on two new top-level A1R5R runs against the exact re-closed evidence, dependency, test-binding, and manifest bytes. After those runs, no evidence file may be changed.

This decision preserves all earlier historical evidence as provenance. It does not claim or authorize a capability probe, Prepare success, live seal, live mutation, live cutover, authority effect, or an actual wrapper/residue poststate.

## 2026-09-06 | External-runtime-closure review addendum

**Decision**: `CONDITIONAL_GO_FOR_EVIDENCE_CLOSED_A1R2_EXTERNAL_RUNTIME_ONLY`

The two pre-evidence full-chain runs each returned exit code `0`, exactly one valid JSON document, PASS `58/58`, Receipt `12/12`, T46 `10/10`, T57 `6/6`, T58 `10/10`, Seal-Closure `10/63/15/4`, `live_capability_probe: not-run`, and a complete null delta. They support evidence re-closure for A1R2 only within the A1-through-A1R5R external-runtime correction.

Final acceptance remains conditional on two new top-level A1R5R runs against the exact re-closed evidence, dependency, test-binding, regression-binding where applicable, and manifest bytes. After those runs, no evidence file may be changed.

This decision preserves all earlier historical evidence as provenance. It does not claim or authorize a capability probe, successful Prepare against a B candidate, live seal, live mutation, live cutover, authority effect, or an actual wrapper/residue poststate.

## 2026-09-07 | File-hash-scope-closure evidence boundary

Decision: CONDITIONAL_GO_FOR_EVIDENCE_CLOSED_A1R2_FILE_HASH_SCOPE_ONLY

The two controlled pre-evidence A1R5R full-chain runs returned identical JSON receipts, each with exit code 0, exactly one JSON document, PASS 58/58, passing T12, T27 and T42, Receipt 12/12, T46 10/10, A1R4 64/64 and its checked upstream chain A1R3 48/48, A1R2 40/40, A1R 34/34 and A1 27/27, T57 nested_hash_scope: 6/6, T58 external_runtime_closure: 10/10, Seal-Closure 10/63/15/4 and live_capability_probe: not-run. Candidate byte identities and the checked B, Ref, FETCH_HEAD and Vault gates were unchanged before and after each run.

The evidence supports the six guard file-hash interfaces and the A1R5R harness bootstrap hash path without Get-FileHash dependence in those paths. T57 used a synthetic B-present file in a fresh Windows PowerShell 5.1 module chain. T42 proves only the expected B-absence stop, not successful Prepare with the real B candidate. This is not a claim that every harness or platform operation is independent of Get-FileHash.

Final acceptance is CONDITIONAL_FINAL_PASS_AFTER_TWO_EXACT_FULL_CHAIN_RECLOSURE_RUNS. It requires two separately authorized new A1R5R full-chain runs against the exact evidence-closed bytes with all agreed checks and unchanged protected gates. After both pass, no evidence file may be changed.

No real B Prepare success, capability probe, live seal, live mutation, live cutover, authority effect or probe-observed wrapper/residue poststate is claimed or authorized. All previous sections remain unchanged historical provenance, not acceptance of this new candidate.
